# Test creating a PV for a product that does not exist.
#
# In check mode: we should simply report that we created the new PV instead of
# raising a 404 error.
#
# In non-check mode: we should raise a 404 error.
#
# Future behavior improvements:
# - Update the check mode message to warn that the product does not exist.
# - Update the non-check mode error message to explain the product does not
#   exist (instead of a raise_for_status() backtrace).
