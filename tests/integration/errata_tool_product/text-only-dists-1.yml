# Test setting the text_only_advisories_require_dists field.
#
# This test case exercises the ability to set the deprecated
# text_only_advisories_require_dists parameter, so we ensure that existing
# playbooks will run without crashing.
#
# Remove this test when we remove support for
# text_only_advisories_require_dists entirely.
